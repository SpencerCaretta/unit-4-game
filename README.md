# unit-4-game

This Crystal Collector game was made to demonstate javascript and jquery knowledge to some degree.  
It utilizes on click functions, a reset function, if and else-if conditionals, etc.
It also uses previously learned html and css.  References Bootstrap, utilizes a reset.css file to make the game
look the same on all web browsers.

Directions are on the game itself as well:
Each Crystal is assigned a random value and the user is given a random number to achieve.  If the user gets to the correct number,
the game resets and the user can play again and they get a win.  If the user goes over, they get a loss and the game resets.
